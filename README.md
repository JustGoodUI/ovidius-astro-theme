## ⚙️ Configuration Notes

### `astro.config.mjs`

Set your deployed domain in the `site` property:

```js
// astro.config.mjs
export default defineConfig({
  site: 'https://example.com'
});
```

This is required for correct image optimization and sitemap generation.

### `site-config.ts`

All site-wide data and theme options are stored in `src/data/site-config.ts`. It provides a single configuration object used throughout the theme for navigation, branding, hero content, social links, and more.

You can update this file to customize:

- Site identity — title, description, logo, and default social share image
- Navigation — primary and secondary navigation links
- Social links — icons and URLs for supported platforms
- Hero section — title, text, avatar, and background image
- Newsletter subscription — form settings suitable for Mailchimp, Formspree, ConvertKit, or other form-based providers. The form supports a custom action URL, configurable email and hidden fields, and an optional honeypot field for spam protection.
- Pagination — posts per page for blog listings

Images can be referenced either as imports from `src/assets/` (for optimized Astro images) or as string paths from the `public/` directory.

### Images

The theme uses a `CustomImage` component that automatically displays images using Astro’s optimized `<Image />` or a standard `<img>` tag depending on the source.

- Content collection images (used in posts or pages) must be stored in `src/assets/` since they use Astro’s `image()` schema.
- Site-config images (like the logo, hero background, or social preview) can either be imported from `src/assets/` for optimization or referenced directly from `public/` (e.g. /logo.svg) if you prefer not to optimize them.

The `public/` directory can still be used for static files like favicons, fonts, or robots.txt.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of Ovidius Astro theme, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── data/
│   ├── layouts/
│   ├── pages/
│   ├── styles/
│   ├── utils/
│   ├── content.config.ts
│   └── types.ts
├── astro.config.mjs
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro (`.astro`) components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.
